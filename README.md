# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Portfolio ðŸ“Š

This repository contains a collection of my exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects, completed in Jupyter Notebooks. The primary goal of these projects is to investigate various datasets to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and summarize their main characteristics using data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
* **NumPy** for numerical operations

## Notebooks
* **[Name of Notebook 1 (e.g., Telecom Churn EDA)](https://github.com/arushsingh0604/EDA/blob/main/EDA%20GItHub/CustomerChurnTele.ipynb):** An analysis of customer data to find the key drivers of churn.
